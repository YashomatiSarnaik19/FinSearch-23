Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize stocks trading
In this project we have created a self learning agent using Q-learning to optimise stocks trading and thus maximise investment returns. 
We also created benchmark models based on ARIMA and LSTM for price prediction to compare the efficiency of our RL model.
