Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize stocks trading<br>
In this project we have created a self learning agent using Q-learning to optimise stocks trading and thus maximise investment returns. <br>
We also created benchmark models based on ARIMA and LSTM for price prediction to compare the efficiency of our RL model.<br><br><br>
